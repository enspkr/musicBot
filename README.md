# Discord Music Bot

ðŸŽµ This is an upgraded version of an existing Discord music bot project. I added new features and improved the bot to better suit my needs, while keeping the core functionality of the original project.

Itâ€™s built with **discord.py** and **yt-dlp** and includes features like queueing, playlist support, single/queue looping, and more!

## ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Play music from YouTube links or search queries
âœ… Play entire YouTube playlists
âœ… Toggle loop for single songs
âœ… Toggle loop for the entire queue
âœ… Pause, resume, skip, and stop playback
âœ… Works directly in your Discord server with slash commands

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- ffmpeg (installed and added to your PATH) https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
